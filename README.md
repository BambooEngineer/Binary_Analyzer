# Binary_Analyzer
Code for one of my Arduino Devices. It analyzes 'Binary like' Combinations created with 3 switches and sends different tones to a piezo buzzer for each combo. Theres also a Tactile switch to make the device act as a Binary Counter. Switching between each mode is done with a fourth switch.
